Even if you are doing 60 hours a week, expect to get dirty looks because of the Amazon-on-steroids workaholic culture that is imposed from the top down. I cannot stress enough how bad the work life balance is. If you are considering an offer, you should consider it a trade for 4 years of feeling horrible.Management is incredibly inexperienced, out of touch, and has no grasp on reality. Decisions at the top level are completely arbitrary and leadership regularly ignores the advice of their subordinates. Management will send out mails after a mandatory weekend telling employees how it was \"so cool\" and \"felt like a startup again.\"You will absolutely have your skills squandered and ideas suppressed. As the company nears IPO, people are focused on empire building and keeping high quality talent suppressed. This leads to a ton of C-list talent being hired, which is very frustrating.

        "pro": "- Interview Experience: Unlike other big name companies, the entire interview process was very smooth, quick and well structured. It took me about 2 weeks from the time the recruiter first contacted me to the time I got the offer. The recruiters were really prompt on following up on all the minor details, very adjustable to scheduling and quick to respond on interview results. The overall interview experience itself was unique where I had my lunch interviewer take me for a walk by the beach after having lunch with the entire team. The interviews were very similar to what you expect at any top tech company but I really liked the fact that I was allowed to code in an IDE of my choice instead of writing on white board.- On-boarding process: The new hire on-boarding process is brief and to the point. It was a sweet surprise to see that people already know you by name when you are taken for walk around the campus buildings.- Engineering team: The engineering team is well organized and well structured. Its a great opportunity to do full stack development where you are allowed to work on features end to end. There is a strong sense of ownership and commitment to deliver features. Every team has a good mix of junior and senior developers. Since it is such a small team and the product is growing continuously, there are plenty of opportunities to showcase your potential and grow.- Work: Because of the unique and ephemeral nature of the product, the work is really challenging and interesting. It's good to have your entire day focussed on solving the problem as I spend less than 30 minutes a day on emails and meetings. It also allows me to get work done quickly and leave early.- Office space: Although, I was initially skeptical about working in an office space right by the beach, I have started to really like it now. Its literally a beach house transferred to office space and it has all the amenities with an amazing view from the roof top and the deck. Whenever I see myself getting stuck in a problem, I tend to go for a walk by the beach to the shore and refresh myself. Sometimes, we just go out and relax ourselves with a game of volley ball. The office staff are really kind and there is security people in and around the building 24X7.- Food: It's really great that I can turn up at work and not worry about cooking lunch or dinner as food is prepared by the chef daily and the entire team has lunch together. If you want to eat outside, there is also an option to eat at a few handpicked restaurants just by showing your badge.- Transparency: Every engineering team meets with the leadership team on weekly basis where we are told about all the different things happening within the company - new features, growth, monetization strategy, etc. It is quite amazing to see the level of business details shared with the engineering team.- Compensation: The base pay is comparable to any other top tech companies and no other tech company can match the equity portion provided here.",

        "pro": "Given the general media perception of the company, when I joined the company, I was expecting it to be less serious and more flamboyant than most new age tech firms today. However, Snapchat is a place that turned out to be as, if not a little more serious, than most of them. The people here are extremely driven and motivated.I think what drives a lot of Snapchat's views, beliefs, and policies, is the fact that it has not let its ideologies be motivated or influenced by external stimuli. Most of the decisions taken here are very objective and independent, and unlike a lot of what I saw at various Bay Area firms. A lot of this originates from the upper level management.My favorite thing about working here is being in the middle of such a rapid and crucial growth phase. Being an active part of such growth is a very educational process, and it is really motivating to see people going above and beyond to push the company forward. It really shows and promotes a general sense of ownership and dedication.",

Unlike every other tech company, working from home is frowned upon. But you'll be too scared to ask, so it doesn't matter.- Mandatory Wednesday evening meetings.... seriously.- Very junior leadership across the company- Shocking amounts of red-tape and bureaucracy for such a small company- Negative, fear-driven, top-down culture- Less competitive salaries, benefits, & perks to Silicon Valley competitors (see below)- Horrific equity vesting schedule over 4 years: 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% whereas almost every other company you vest 25% a year for 4 years.- 10 days of PTO a year and 5 sick days (No, I'm not joking, and yes this is 2015. Better not get sick this year... or any year!)- No performance reviews/salary adjustments, etc.- No bonus structure- No 401k matching- All those really cool tech company perks you've heard about: we don't have any of them.- Far from the rest of the tech community in the Silicon Valley (means limited options when it's time to change jobs)- Cost of living in Venice/Santa Monica is insane. Bay Area prices.Less Egregious Cons:- Working by Venice beach can actually be pretty annoying, loud, or even scary- If you didn't join the company early enough to get a parking spot, you have to park in a lot 1 mile away and take a (free) shuttle to the office.

        "pro": "Snapchat has been the best experience of my professional career thus far. It is a true start-up, but without the risks. No job is too small or too large, and the amount of impact and influence you have in your role (whether you're an intern or an exec) is infinite. It's a collaborative and friendly environment, and the organization truly values and invests in the individuals.The work is fast paced and challenging and you're surrounded by the most intelligent individuals on a daily basis. If you're looking for growth and excitement, you will find it at Snapchat.",
        "con": "Hours can be long and the workload can be heavy. I don't necessarily see this as a con, however, as the growth potential as an individual due to these two factors is bigger than I've seen at most companies.Also note that Snapchat is not the kind of place for someone looking for frills and perks. It's a place to get your hands dirty and there are times where you might be working on projects outside of your day-to-day responsibilities. For some, like myself, I love this. For others, this can be frustrating and if you're the type of person that's looking for routine and predictability, this place probably isn't for you. Snapchat requires flexibility and a team oriented mentality.",
        "advice": "Continue to enable, encourage and invest in the talent. As the organization grows, would love to see the culture stay intact. Also given the rapid growth, would like to see us stay away from becoming too process driven, as some organizations move in this direction.",
